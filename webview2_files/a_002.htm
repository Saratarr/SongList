class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2.34" data-time-end="4.47"><span>about methods and arrays. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="4.47" data-time-end="5.61"><span>So the first thing </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="5.61" data-time-end="6.33"><span>we're going to do is we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="6.33" data-time-end="8.925"><span>create a valid input function. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="8.925" data-time-end="11.88"><span>So go to your project and let's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="11.88" data-time-end="15.075"><span>open it up and then look for the SLM, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="15.075" data-time-end="16.41"><span>there it is, I'm </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="16.41" data-time-end="17.76"><span>going to double-click to open </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="17.76" data-time-end="21.31"><span>up the project using the SLM. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="22.94" data-time-end="25.77"><span>Then if your form is not showing, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="25.77" data-time-end="27.09"><span>just come over here and double-click on </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="27.09" data-time-end="28.62"><span>the form where it </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="28.62" data-time-end="32.28"><span>says main form, there we go. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="32.28" data-time-end="34.89"><span>And now we want to get to the code, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="34.89" data-time-end="36.125"><span>so to get to the code, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="36.125" data-time-end="39.26"><span>you just hit ''View'' and then Code. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="39.26" data-time-end="42.17"><span>So this is the code and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="42.17" data-time-end="43.25"><span>the first thing is we want to create </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="43.25" data-time-end="45.29"><span>a valid input function. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="45.29" data-time-end="47.79"><span>And the valid input function, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="47.79" data-time-end="50.07"><span>let's look at the logic for </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="50.07" data-time-end="52.865"><span>this and you can see initially, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="52.865" data-time-end="54.71"><span>you click on the button and we check to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="54.71" data-time-end="56.69"><span>see if the fields are empty or not, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="56.69" data-time-end="58.31"><span>if they are empty would give </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="58.31" data-time-end="60.48"><span>an error and then we end it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="60.48" data-time-end="61.71"><span>If none of them are empty, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="61.71" data-time-end="65.3"><span>then we go ahead and build the output text. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="65.3" data-time-end="67.55"><span>So we're going to simplify it </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="67.55" data-time-end="69.95"><span>by simply calling a method and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="69.95" data-time-end="71.58"><span>then doing the work by letting </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="71.58" data-time-end="74.13"><span>the method do the validating, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="74.13" data-time-end="75.515"><span>so it's going to really </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="75.515" data-time-end="77.615"><span>simplify our code quite a bit. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="77.615" data-time-end="79.625"><span>So now what does that method do? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="79.625" data-time-end="81.02"><span>That method is going to be doing </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="81.02" data-time-end="82.15"><span>the validation, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="82.15" data-time-end="85.955"><span>it's going to initialize as true </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="85.955" data-time-end="88.28"><span>that everything is good but then it's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="88.28" data-time-end="89.51"><span>going to check and if it hits </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="89.51" data-time-end="90.875"><span>something that's bad, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="90.875" data-time-end="92.63"><span>then it is going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="92.63" data-time-end="95"><span>flip it to false, see that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="95" data-time-end="96.815"><span>And then it's going to return </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="96.815" data-time-end="98.585"><span>either true that everything's good, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="98.585" data-time-end="100.805"><span>or was it flipped, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="100.805" data-time-end="102.805"><span>and then it's going to return a false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="102.805" data-time-end="104.415"><span>so that's the logic. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="104.415" data-time-end="106.095"><span>So let's go ahead and pull that off. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="106.095" data-time-end="107.405"><span>So you can see here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="107.405" data-time-end="108.8"><span>they're giving us an idea </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="108.8" data-time-end="110.27"><span>of how to make this work, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="110.27" data-time-end="112.055"><span>so let's go ahead and make it happen. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="112.055" data-time-end="113.63"><span>Now you can do methods, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="113.63" data-time-end="117.015"><span>methods have to be side-by-side, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="117.015" data-time-end="119.285"><span>you cannot have a method inside of a method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="119.285" data-time-end="120.725"><span>we have to really be careful. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="120.725" data-time-end="122.84"><span>So this right here is a method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="122.84" data-time-end="124.24"><span>and this right here is a method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="124.24" data-time-end="125.9"><span>So we can go in between the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="125.9" data-time-end="128.12"><span>two and we can put a new method right there, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="128.12" data-time-end="129.47"><span>so that's where we're going to do it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="129.47" data-time-end="131.585"><span>So I'm going to go ahead and say public </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="131.585" data-time-end="133.01"><span>and then it's going to return </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="133.01" data-time-end="134.435"><span>back either true or false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="134.435" data-time-end="135.48"><span>and that's a Boolean. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="135.48" data-time-end="137.675"><span>So I'm going to say a bool, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="137.675" data-time-end="139.76"><span>and then we want the method to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="139.76" data-time-end="142.535"><span>be called ValidInput, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="142.535" data-time-end="144.66"><span>left paren, right paren, so </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="144.66" data-time-end="146.22"><span>curly brace Enter key, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="146.22" data-time-end="147.26"><span>and I'm getting that </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="147.26" data-time-end="148.735"><span>from right here by the way. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="148.735" data-time-end="151.785"><span>So now what does this do? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="151.785" data-time-end="153.855"><span>It is going to return </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="153.855" data-time-end="164.85"><span>true if all fields are non-empty. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="166.75" data-time-end="168.68"><span>So what we're going </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="168.68" data-time-end="169.66"><span>to do is we're going to assume </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="169.66" data-time-end="171.805"><span>that everything is good, so let's say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="171.805" data-time-end="174.4"><span>Boolean isValid, and we're going </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="174.4" data-time-end="175.54"><span>to assume that everything's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="175.54" data-time-end="177.94"><span>good just by setting it to true. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="177.94" data-time-end="179.89"><span>Then what we're going to do </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="179.89" data-time-end="181.255"><span>is we're going to check </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="181.255" data-time-end="185.17"><span>each item and see if it's true or not, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="185.17" data-time-end="187.12"><span>so what we want to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="187.12" data-time-end="189.37"><span>do is we want to come down here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="189.37" data-time-end="192.04"><span>and this right here is our Add button. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="192.04" data-time-end="194.27"><span>We already have the logic here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="194.27" data-time-end="195.745"><span>so let's come on over here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="195.745" data-time-end="197.11"><span>and let's go ahead and grab </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="197.11" data-time-end="199.72"><span>this logic from the Add button. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="199.72" data-time-end="201.805"><span>So we're going to grab the if </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="201.805" data-time-end="204.76"><span>all the way down to the else right here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="204.76" data-time-end="209.2"><span>Now, I'm not going to grab the else, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="209.2" data-time-end="211.085"><span>so I'm going to grab all of it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="211.085" data-time-end="214.89"><span>the parts that actually do the checking. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="214.89" data-time-end="216.955"><span>So now that I've got all of this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="216.955" data-time-end="218.065"><span>I'm going to right-click on </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="218.065" data-time-end="222.2"><span>it and I'm going to hit ''Cut'', </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="222.2" data-time-end="225.72"><span>so that's going to cut it to the clipboard. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="225.72" data-time-end="227.64"><span>Now we have an error here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="227.64" data-time-end="229.99"><span>you can see blood right there and we'll </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="229.99" data-time-end="233.05"><span>need to finish the logic in this method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="233.05" data-time-end="235.719"><span>But all those if elses, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="235.719" data-time-end="238.075"><span>we want them up here in the method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="238.075" data-time-end="240.19"><span>so I'm gong to come over here and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="240.19" data-time-end="242.415"><span>then I'm going to paste. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="242.415" data-time-end="243.569"><span>So I'm going to right-click </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="243.569" data-time-end="245.145"><span>and I'm going to paste. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="245.145" data-time-end="248.145"><span>So here in the ValidInput method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="248.145" data-time-end="250.62"><span>we assume that everything's good, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="250.62" data-time-end="252.735"><span>but then we check each item. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="252.735" data-time-end="254.295"><span>And now check this out, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="254.295" data-time-end="255.62"><span>if you look over here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="255.62" data-time-end="256.955"><span>you can see that they say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="256.955" data-time-end="258.56"><span>if we hit something that's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="258.56" data-time-end="263.25"><span>bad, isValid becomes false. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="263.25" data-time-end="264.26"><span>So we're going to come </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="264.26" data-time-end="265.76"><span>over here and dominate, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="265.76" data-time-end="267.755"><span>drop this down and I want to say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="267.755" data-time-end="272.055"><span>if we hit an empty titleText box, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="272.055" data-time-end="276.465"><span>then isValid becomes false. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="276.465" data-time-end="279.3"><span>You see that? So what happens if </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="279.3" data-time-end="282"><span>we hit an artistText that's empty? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="282" data-time-end="284.39"><span>Well, we say isValid, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="284.39" data-time-end="286.49"><span>now I just typed is and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="286.49" data-time-end="289.01"><span>Visual Studio is trying </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="289.01" data-time-end="290.5"><span>to finish the code for me, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="290.5" data-time-end="291.62"><span>so that's awesome </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="291.62" data-time-end="293.42"><span>because it's actually correct. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="293.42" data-time-end="296.35"><span>So we're going to say isValid, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="296.35" data-time-end="299.57"><span>now, it did an ampersand equals, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="299.57" data-time-end="301.31"><span>so I'm going to get rid of the ampersand. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="301.31" data-time-end="303.845"><span>So isValid is false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="303.845" data-time-end="308.525"><span>so it's not valid because the artists field, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="308.525" data-time-end="310.345"><span>the text is blank. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="310.345" data-time-end="311.69"><span>Now we're going to come down here and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="311.69" data-time-end="312.9"><span>do this for all of them. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="312.9" data-time-end="314.06"><span>So we're going to pop over </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="314.06" data-time-end="315.23"><span>here and we're going to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="315.23" data-time-end="320.55"><span>isValid is false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="320.57" data-time-end="322.43"><span>and then we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="322.43" data-time-end="323.33"><span>do it for this one as well. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="323.33" data-time-end="325.28"><span>So we have to go through every single branch. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="325.28" data-time-end="327.08"><span>If we hit something that's blank, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="327.08" data-time-end="329.12"><span>we're going to say isValid </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="329.12" data-time-end="331.49"><span>becomes false like that, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="331.49" data-time-end="333.87"><span>all the way down to here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="341.21" data-time-end="346.2"><span>There we go. So now we're going to come down </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="346.2" data-time-end="347.99"><span>here and then we're simply going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="347.99" data-time-end="350.915"><span>return isValid, and that's it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="350.915" data-time-end="356.66"><span>So if we do not have a blank text field, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="356.66" data-time-end="359.89"><span>then isValid remains true </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="359.89" data-time-end="361.745"><span>like we said it at the very beginning. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="361.745" data-time-end="365.42"><span>However, if we hit a blank text field, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="365.42" data-time-end="369.13"><span>then isValid gets flipped to false. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="369.13" data-time-end="371.18"><span>So that means when we're returning that, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="371.18" data-time-end="372.32"><span>it's going to be either true </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="372.32" data-time-end="374.15"><span>because it did not go inside of any of </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="374.15" data-time-end="375.885"><span>the if blocks or it's going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="375.885" data-time-end="378.5"><span>be false because it did, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="378.5" data-time-end="380.47"><span>because we did find any of the box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="380.47" data-time-end="381.44"><span>And that's how we do </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="381.44" data-time-end="383.65"><span>validation using this method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="383.65" data-time-end="385.425"><span>So now we're coming down here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="385.425" data-time-end="387.125"><span>let's go ahead and see what's next. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="387.125" data-time-end="389.42"><span>Now, we need to update </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="389.42" data-time-end="393.81"><span>our Add button using that method call. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="393.81" data-time-end="395.81"><span>So we're going to come back down </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="395.81" data-time-end="397.49"><span>here to our Add button </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="397.49" data-time-end="400.97"><span>here and we're going to say here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="400.97" data-time-end="402.575"><span>instead of using the else, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="402.575" data-time-end="403.475"><span>we're going to say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="403.475" data-time-end="405.925"><span>if and there we're going to call the method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="405.925" data-time-end="408.99"><span>we're going to say ValidInput, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="408.99" data-time-end="410.595"><span>is the name of our method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="410.595" data-time-end="416.48"><span>ValidInput, we're going to call that method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="416.48" data-time-end="418.88"><span>And if it gives us a true, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="418.88" data-time-end="420.2"><span>then it's going to come in here and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="420.2" data-time-end="421.34"><span>it's going to run this code. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="421.34" data-time-end="423.83"><span>If it gives us a false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="423.83" data-time-end="425.84"><span>then it's not going to run this code. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="425.84" data-time-end="427.55"><span>We don't have an else, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="427.55" data-time-end="429.35"><span>so therefore it's not going to do anything. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="429.35" data-time-end="432.23"><span>We don't want it to do anything because if </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="432.23" data-time-end="435.379"><span>it did hit a blank </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="435.379" data-time-end="437.795"><span>that we have already shown </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="437.795" data-time-end="442.12"><span>a message box based on what item was blank. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="442.12" data-time-end="445.19"><span>So when you click the Add button, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="445.19" data-time-end="447.44"><span>then it's going to run </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="447.44" data-time-end="451.28"><span>the method and if it receives a true, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="451.28" data-time-end="453.455"><span>then it's going to do the work. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="453.455" data-time-end="455.03"><span>However, if it receives a </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="455.03" data-time-end="457.31"><span>false then it would have already </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="457.31" data-time-end="460.24"><span>shown us what was wrong and then it's not </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="460.24" data-time-end="461.41"><span>going to do anything because there's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="461.41" data-time-end="463.76"><span>no else on here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="463.76" data-time-end="465.74"><span>So this is good. Now, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="465.74" data-time-end="468.655"><span>declare arrays of titles, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="468.655" data-time-end="472.6"><span>artists, genres, and URLs, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="472.6" data-time-end="476.01"><span>years, and you need to do that at the very </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="476.01" data-time-end="478.87"><span>top because we want to be </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="478.87" data-time-end="480.4"><span>able to access that array </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="480.4" data-time-end="481.955"><span>from all of the methods. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="481.955" data-time-end="483.34"><span>So we need to do it at </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="483.34" data-time-end="486.94"><span>the form level or the class level. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="486.94" data-time-end="487.87"><span>So I'm going to come up here </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="487.87" data-time-end="488.935"><span>to the very top, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="488.935" data-time-end="490.54"><span>right here, because right </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="490.54" data-time-end="492.745"><span>here is where the class is created. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="492.745" data-time-end="495.46"><span>So right here at the very top, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="495.46" data-time-end="497.545"><span>is where you want to create </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="497.545" data-time-end="501.26"><span>your class level references. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="501.59" data-time-end="503.65"><span>So let's go ahead and create </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="503.65" data-time-end="506.515"><span>an array for each of our items. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="506.515" data-time-end="507.955"><span>So the first one, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="507.955" data-time-end="512.59"><span>so string array and then this is going to be </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="512.59" data-time-end="516.49"><span>the titleArray and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="516.49" data-time-end="519.94"><span>we want to have it be five large, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="519.94" data-time-end="522.475"><span>so I'm going to say five positions. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="522.475" data-time-end="524.56"><span>So this is going to be the titleArray. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="524.56" data-time-end="528.705"><span>We can hold up to five titles, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="528.705" data-time-end="532.33"><span>and then I'm going to grab this one. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="532.88" data-time-end="535.89"><span>I'm going to do a Control C to copy, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="535.89" data-time-end="540.27"><span>then Control V and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="540.27" data-time-end="543.825"><span>that gives us five, that's good. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="543.825" data-time-end="546.035"><span>So the second one is going to be </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="546.035" data-time-end="549.64"><span>our artistArray and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="549.64" data-time-end="553.37"><span>our next one is going to be our genreArray. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="556.53" data-time-end="559.825"><span>&gt;&gt; Then the next one is a year. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="559.825" data-time-end="561.175"><span>So that's going to be an integer, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="561.175" data-time-end="563.65"><span>we have to change the datatype to integer. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="563.65" data-time-end="567.595"><span>And then this is going to be our year array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="567.595" data-time-end="569.77"><span>Then the last one is going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="569.77" data-time-end="572.21"><span>be our URL array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="574.41" data-time-end="576.88"><span>We have arrays for each </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="576.88" data-time-end="578.455"><span>of our items and we can hold </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="578.455" data-time-end="581.965"><span>up to five different songs </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="581.965" data-time-end="584.68"><span>so that the data for five different songs. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="584.68" data-time-end="589.3"><span>Directly below, include a song count. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="589.3" data-time-end="590.41"><span>We're going to come over </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="590.41" data-time-end="591.25"><span>here and we're going to go ahead </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="591.25" data-time-end="594.94"><span>and say song count. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="594.94" data-time-end="597.865"><span>We're in, started off at zero. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="597.865" data-time-end="601.28"><span>At this point we have zero songs. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="603.99" data-time-end="608.575"><span>And now edit the Add button click event. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="608.575" data-time-end="610"><span>I'm going to come over here </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="610" data-time-end="611.545"><span>and you can actually get </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="611.545" data-time-end="613"><span>straight into it by just </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="613" data-time-end="614.74"><span>clicking inside of the class, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="614.74" data-time-end="616.255"><span>you got to be inside of the class, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="616.255" data-time-end="617.68"><span>and then you can come here to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="617.68" data-time-end="619.975"><span>this drop-down right here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="619.975" data-time-end="621.475"><span>And if I hit the drop-down, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="621.475" data-time-end="622.78"><span>you can see I have access to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="622.78" data-time-end="623.98"><span>all of the methods. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="623.98" data-time-end="625.39"><span>If I scroll up, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="625.39" data-time-end="628.57"><span>I can see the Add button click Event Method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="628.57" data-time-end="629.8"><span>So I'm going to click on here </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="629.8" data-time-end="631.585"><span>and it takes me right to it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="631.585" data-time-end="633.535"><span>Now at this point, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="633.535" data-time-end="636.8"><span>increment the song counter </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="637.92" data-time-end="640.57"><span>which you declared. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="640.57" data-time-end="645.28"><span>That's going to be, let's see. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="645.28" data-time-end="647.83"><span>So increment the song counter </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="647.83" data-time-end="649.27"><span>which you declared and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="649.27" data-time-end="650.62"><span>initialized with zeros just under </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="650.62" data-time-end="651.91"><span>the declarations for the arrays. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="651.91" data-time-end="653.53"><span>We did that already. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="653.53" data-time-end="656.095"><span>Then you want to increment it </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="656.095" data-time-end="658.69"><span>when a song is successfully added. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="658.69" data-time-end="661.36"><span>So when the song is successfully added </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="661.36" data-time-end="664.94"><span>means it has to be inside of here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="665.55" data-time-end="668.155"><span>Let's go ahead and put it right here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="668.155" data-time-end="670.225"><span>So I'm going to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="670.225" data-time-end="675.505"><span>increments these songs counter. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="675.505" data-time-end="679.735"><span>So we're going to say song count plus, plus. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="679.735" data-time-end="682.405"><span>That's how we increase it by one. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="682.405" data-time-end="685.81"><span>Then it says insert new song data </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="685.81" data-time-end="687.31"><span>at the array position </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="687.31" data-time-end="688.6"><span>indicated by the song counter. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="688.6" data-time-end="690.85"><span>Remember C-sharp indices start </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="690.85" data-time-end="693.385"><span>at zero, not one. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="693.385" data-time-end="699.01"><span>So we want to make sure that we increment it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="699.01" data-time-end="702.039"><span>Let's see. Add title to list, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="702.039" data-time-end="704.005"><span>box and song list. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="704.005" data-time-end="706.675"><span>Let's go ahead and do it right here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="706.675" data-time-end="709.21"><span>You want to have before you increment, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="709.21" data-time-end="711.415"><span>because remember, we start at zero. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="711.415" data-time-end="712.96"><span>The first song, we want to put </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="712.96" data-time-end="715.03"><span>it at position 0. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="715.03" data-time-end="717.685"><span>So you need to do it before you increment. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="717.685" data-time-end="719.005"><span>So let's go ahead and do it right here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="719.005" data-time-end="720.28"><span>We're going to go ahead and say here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="720.28" data-time-end="725.63"><span>add title to list box and the song list. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="726.84" data-time-end="729.16"><span>We're going to pop here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="729.16" data-time-end="731.665"><span>we are going to say title, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="731.665" data-time-end="735.175"><span>array at position. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="735.175" data-time-end="736.72"><span>What position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="736.72" data-time-end="740.68"><span>Song list or song count, so song count. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="740.68" data-time-end="743.995"><span>Initially song count is going to be zero. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="743.995" data-time-end="745.75"><span>So we're going to add it to position </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="745.75" data-time-end="747.685"><span>0 for the first time around, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="747.685" data-time-end="749.08"><span>then we're going to increment to one. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="749.08" data-time-end="750.7"><span>The second song, we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="750.7" data-time-end="752.35"><span>add it to position 1, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="752.35" data-time-end="754.09"><span>and then two and then three. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="754.09" data-time-end="756.22"><span>That's how we're using our array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="756.22" data-time-end="758.155"><span>Then we're going to go ahead and say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="758.155" data-time-end="763.75"><span>this is going to be our title text dot text. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="763.75" data-time-end="765.79"><span>That's going to be, we're going </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="765.79" data-time-end="767.47"><span>to take the texts from </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="767.47" data-time-end="770.68"><span>the title textbox and then put it into </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="770.68" data-time-end="774.91"><span>the zero position of our title array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="774.91" data-time-end="776.14"><span>Here we do the exact </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="776.14" data-time-end="777.685"><span>same thing for the artists. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="777.685" data-time-end="779.23"><span>We're going to say artists </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="779.23" data-time-end="781.21"><span>array at song count is </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="781.21" data-time-end="784.9"><span>going to be artist at text. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="784.9" data-time-end="786.895"><span>And you see that </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="786.895" data-time-end="790.72"><span>Visual Studios finishing the code for me. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="790.72" data-time-end="793.63"><span>Artists array, song count is going to be </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="793.63" data-time-end="796.69"><span>assigned whatever is in the text fields, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="796.69" data-time-end="799.165"><span>text property of the artists texts. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="799.165" data-time-end="800.44"><span>And you can see it's already doing </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="800.44" data-time-end="802.3"><span>the genre array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="802.3" data-time-end="804.775"><span>Visual Studio is doing this for me, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="804.775" data-time-end="806.17"><span>I'm going to go ahead and hit my tab </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="806.17" data-time-end="807.655"><span>key and accept it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="807.655" data-time-end="809.74"><span>Then I'm going to hit my "Enter Key." </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="809.74" data-time-end="811.99"><span>And then now we're going to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="811.99" data-time-end="814.99"><span>the year array at </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="814.99" data-time-end="822.985"><span>position song count is going to be assigned. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="822.985" data-time-end="824.29"><span>And now here's the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="824.29" data-time-end="825.685"><span>part we had to think about. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="825.685" data-time-end="831.88"><span>The text fields hold strings. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="831.88" data-time-end="834.265"><span>You cannot put a string </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="834.265" data-time-end="836.74"><span>into an integer array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="836.74" data-time-end="838.96"><span>What we have to do is we have to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="838.96" data-time-end="840.865"><span>take that string, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="840.865" data-time-end="844.36"><span>I'm going to say year, text, dot text. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="844.36" data-time-end="846.745"><span>But I have to take that year, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="846.745" data-time-end="850.24"><span>the string, and I will put it in parenthesis. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="850.24" data-time-end="851.95"><span>And what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="851.95" data-time-end="853.57"><span>in front of it and I'm </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="853.57" data-time-end="857.11"><span>going to say integer dot parse. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="857.11" data-time-end="859.615"><span>So Integer.parse means convert </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="859.615" data-time-end="862.435"><span>the string into a number. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="862.435" data-time-end="864.325"><span>It converted into an integer. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="864.325" data-time-end="866.65"><span>Now I put a semicolon on the end. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="866.65" data-time-end="868.24"><span>Then finally, we're going to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="868.24" data-time-end="873.7"><span>URL array at song account </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="873.7" data-time-end="875.08"><span>is going to be whatever is in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="875.08" data-time-end="877.795"><span>the text fields texts property. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="877.795" data-time-end="881.11"><span>There we go. Now once we've </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="881.11" data-time-end="884.469"><span>got all of the data into the array, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="884.469" data-time-end="886.705"><span>we're still putting the title </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="886.705" data-time-end="889.045"><span>into our list box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="889.045" data-time-end="890.29"><span>But then we're also putting </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="890.29" data-time-end="892.075"><span>the title into the title array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="892.075" data-time-end="894.4"><span>We're putting all of our data into the array. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="894.4" data-time-end="897.385"><span>This way we can work with it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="897.385" data-time-end="899.14"><span>Then once we do that, we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="899.14" data-time-end="900.97"><span>increment the song count and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="900.97" data-time-end="903.145"><span>we're going to still show all the information </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="903.145" data-time-end="906.95"><span>down in the text field. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="907.26" data-time-end="914.6"><span>Let's see.

Let's see what's next. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="961.855" data-time-end="965.035"><span>Write a method and call it int, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="965.035" data-time-end="971.515"><span>get song index and then given a song title. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="971.515" data-time-end="973.33"><span>Let's go ahead and do that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="973.33" data-time-end="974.47"><span>I'm going to come down here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="974.47" data-time-end="977.44"><span>Then remember, methods have to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="977.44" data-time-end="981.205"><span>be outside of all other methods. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="981.205" data-time-end="983.17"><span>So this is the end of </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="983.17" data-time-end="984.1"><span>one method and this is </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="984.1" data-time-end="985.57"><span>the beginning of another method. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="985.57" data-time-end="987.31"><span>I can put it here. It doesn't matter. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="987.31" data-time-end="988"><span>You can put it anywhere you </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="988" data-time-end="988.81"><span>want as long as it's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="988.81" data-time-end="991.24"><span>outside of all other methods. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="991.24" data-time-end="994.09"><span>Then we wanted to be called int. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="994.09" data-time-end="996.56"><span>The first thing is we wanted to be good. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="997.02" data-time-end="998.98"><span>We can make it private </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="998.98" data-time-end="999.97"><span>or you can make it public, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="999.97" data-time-end="1005.235"><span>I think I'll make it private, and then int. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1005.235" data-time-end="1006.72"><span>And I made it private just </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1006.72" data-time-end="1008.37"><span>because I am matching </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1008.37" data-time-end="1011.58"><span>the other methods and I do not see a reason, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1011.58" data-time-end="1016.17"><span>I do not need this outside of this class. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1016.17" data-time-end="1018.42"><span>So you want to make a decision like that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1018.42" data-time-end="1019.83"><span>So now we're going to go ahead and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1019.83" data-time-end="1024.345"><span>say get song index, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1024.345" data-time-end="1034.12"><span>given the name of the song. There we go. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1037.21" data-time-end="1039.17"><span>&gt;&gt; So and then they're </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1039.17" data-time-end="1040.25"><span>showing us that you can </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1040.25" data-time-end="1042.86"><span>take the song list and you </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1042.86" data-time-end="1045.41"><span>can say items is </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1045.41" data-time-end="1049.13"><span>the array list or </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1049.13" data-time-end="1051.965"><span>the collection inside of the list box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1051.965" data-time-end="1053.99"><span>And then you can use IndexOf </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1053.99" data-time-end="1055.13"><span>and if you give it a title, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1055.13" data-time-end="1057.225"><span>it'll tell you where it's actually located. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1057.225" data-time-end="1058.885"><span>So they're actually giving us the code here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1058.885" data-time-end="1059.71"><span>so I'm going to pop over </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1059.71" data-time-end="1061.24"><span>here and I'm going to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1061.24" data-time-end="1068.93"><span>int song index is going to be the list box, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1070.66" data-time-end="1073.13"><span>items is a collection </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1073.13" data-time-end="1074.57"><span>inside of it and then we're </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1074.57" data-time-end="1075.665"><span>going to use the index </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1075.665" data-time-end="1077.72"><span>of and then we're going to say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1077.72" data-time-end="1080.585"><span>given the song title. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1080.585" data-time-end="1082.865"><span>So the song title, this being passed in, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1082.865" data-time-end="1085.49"><span>we're going to see where that is located </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1085.49" data-time-end="1088.565"><span>inside of the collection. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1088.565" data-time-end="1090.905"><span>So now once we have that, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1090.905" data-time-end="1092.195"><span>we need to return it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1092.195" data-time-end="1094.25"><span>so I'm going to go ahead and say return </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1094.25" data-time-end="1097.58"><span>that songIndex like that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1097.58" data-time-end="1099.05"><span>Now, technically I could </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1099.05" data-time-end="1100.13"><span>have actually just returned </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1100.13" data-time-end="1101.54"><span>this part right here instead </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1101.54" data-time-end="1102.815"><span>of doing it in two lines, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1102.815" data-time-end="1104.06"><span>I'm going to go ahead and just do it in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1104.06" data-time-end="1105.26"><span>two lines just to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1105.26" data-time-end="1108.41"><span>keep it as understandable as possible. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1108.41" data-time-end="1109.97"><span>So now I'm going to come on </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1109.97" data-time-end="1113.27"><span>down and now it says </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1113.27" data-time-end="1119.78"><span>create a Boolean SongInList function. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1119.78" data-time-end="1121.61"><span>So I'm going to come right down here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1121.61" data-time-end="1124.175"><span>Again, I'm outside of all other methods, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1124.175" data-time-end="1125.84"><span>so now I'm going to go ahead and just say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1125.84" data-time-end="1130.505"><span>private Boolean SongInList, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1130.505" data-time-end="1134.975"><span>and then string song title. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1134.975" data-time-end="1137.66"><span>So this right here is going to tell us </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1137.66" data-time-end="1140.24"><span>whether or not this song </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1140.24" data-time-end="1143.239"><span>is inside of the list </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1143.239" data-time-end="1145.76"><span>and the function returns true, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1145.76" data-time-end="1148.34"><span>if the song title is in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1148.34" data-time-end="1149.72"><span>the song list or false </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1149.72" data-time-end="1151.31"><span>if not, and then it says, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1151.31" data-time-end="1153.65"><span>use a similar approach as </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1153.65" data-time-end="1156.83"><span>the validate input and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1156.83" data-time-end="1158.03"><span>the function is passed </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1158.03" data-time-end="1160.715"><span>a string which we received right here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1160.715" data-time-end="1165.275"><span>and create a variable, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1165.275" data-time-end="1167.629"><span>so we're go ahead and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1167.629" data-time-end="1171.725"><span>say whether or not it's in the list. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1171.725" data-time-end="1173.03"><span>So let's go ahead and do it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1173.03" data-time-end="1174.29"><span>so here we're going to go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1174.29" data-time-end="1178.535"><span>Boolean found is false, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1178.535" data-time-end="1180.605"><span>so at this point we have not found it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1180.605" data-time-end="1182.27"><span>so we're going to create a Boolean, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1182.27" data-time-end="1183.83"><span>and a Boolean is either true </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1183.83" data-time-end="1185.465"><span>or false and that's it. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1185.465" data-time-end="1188.27"><span>And then they're saying to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1188.27" data-time-end="1189.38"><span>use a for loop and they're </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1189.38" data-time-end="1191.025"><span>giving us the for loop here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1191.025" data-time-end="1193.54"><span>so let's go ahead and take advantage of that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1193.54" data-time-end="1196.72"><span>So I'm going to say for each, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1196.72" data-time-end="1199.02"><span>let me get my tab key two times, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1199.02" data-time-end="1201.275"><span>so that Visual Studio writes it for me, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1201.275" data-time-end="1201.86"><span>I'm going to hit </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1201.86" data-time-end="1204.62"><span>the Tab and it takes me over to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1204.62" data-time-end="1206.33"><span>the collection and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1206.33" data-time-end="1208.22"><span>where is the collection located? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1208.22" data-time-end="1209.51"><span>It's located in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1209.51" data-time-end="1215.105"><span>the songList.items because remember, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1215.105" data-time-end="1216.905"><span>items is the collection </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1216.905" data-time-end="1220.28"><span>inside of the list box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1220.28" data-time-end="1224.81"><span>And then for each item in that collection, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1224.81" data-time-end="1229.505"><span>we want to get the item, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1229.505" data-time-end="1231.725"><span>so I'm going to go ahead and say here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1231.725" data-time-end="1237.89"><span>string current song and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1237.89" data-time-end="1240.41"><span>then I want to take that item and I'm going </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1240.41" data-time-end="1243.99"><span>to use it as a string. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1245.89" data-time-end="1248.6"><span>Then what I want to do is I want </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1248.6" data-time-end="1250.82"><span>to use a lowercase comparison, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1250.82" data-time-end="1252.275"><span>so let's go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1252.275" data-time-end="1254.79"><span>lowercase comparison, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1255.31" data-time-end="1259.71"><span>so not case sensitive. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1260.83" data-time-end="1264.17"><span>So that way, if they say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1264.17" data-time-end="1269.285"><span>purple versus purple with a capital P, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1269.285" data-time-end="1271.235"><span>it's not going to make a difference, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1271.235" data-time-end="1272.045"><span>you see what I mean? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1272.045" data-time-end="1274.85"><span>So if I lowercase both sides, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1274.85" data-time-end="1277.055"><span>then it's no longer case-sensitive. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1277.055" data-time-end="1278.42"><span>So I want to say, if </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1278.42" data-time-end="1280.67"><span>the song title and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1280.67" data-time-end="1281.84"><span>the song title is what </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1281.84" data-time-end="1283.925"><span>we received right there. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1283.925" data-time-end="1289.34"><span>So if the song title converted to lowercase, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1289.34" data-time-end="1291.74"><span>so I'm converting that to lowercase, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1291.74" data-time-end="1293.66"><span>if that's identically equal </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1293.66" data-time-end="1296.57"><span>to the current song, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1296.57" data-time-end="1299.96"><span>converted to lowercase, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1299.96" data-time-end="1302.09"><span>if they're both equal like this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1302.09" data-time-end="1305.06"><span>then what we're going to do is we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1305.06" data-time-end="1308.405"><span>say found is true, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1308.405" data-time-end="1310.415"><span>so we're going to flip the flag. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1310.415" data-time-end="1312.95"><span>I got a little typo there, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1312.95" data-time-end="1314.435"><span>so I'm going to pull this </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1314.435" data-time-end="1317.165"><span>out so we can see it better. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1317.165" data-time-end="1321.17"><span>So you can see that </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1321.17" data-time-end="1323.165"><span>we converted the song title, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1323.165" data-time-end="1325.55"><span>which is what we're looking at, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1325.55" data-time-end="1327.89"><span>to lowercase and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1327.89" data-time-end="1329.975"><span>we converted the current song in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1329.975" data-time-end="1334.87"><span>our list box items, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1334.87" data-time-end="1337.42"><span>the current song to lowercase. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1337.42" data-time-end="1339.19"><span>If they are identically the same, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1339.19" data-time-end="1340.765"><span>we're going to flip our </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1340.765" data-time-end="1341.89"><span>flag and we're going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1341.89" data-time-end="1345.83"><span>say found becomes true. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1346.69" data-time-end="1349.52"><span>Then, once we get through, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1349.52" data-time-end="1351.635"><span>so make sure you're outside of the for-loop, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1351.635" data-time-end="1353.435"><span>then we're going to return found. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1353.435" data-time-end="1356.315"><span>So we set found to false does not exist, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1356.315" data-time-end="1358.085"><span>we're going to go through each item </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1358.085" data-time-end="1359.255"><span>and if we match, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1359.255" data-time-end="1360.44"><span>we're going to flip our flag to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1360.44" data-time-end="1362.84"><span>true and then in all cases, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1362.84" data-time-end="1365.345"><span>we're going to return found. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1365.345" data-time-end="1369.395"><span>So add a fine song button. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1369.395" data-time-end="1370.685"><span>So let's go ahead and do that, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1370.685" data-time-end="1372.559"><span>I'm going to come over here to the Designer </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1372.559" data-time-end="1374.03"><span>, I'm going to grab this button, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1374.03" data-time-end="1375.845"><span>I'm going to right-click copy, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1375.845" data-time-end="1378.14"><span>right-click paste and I'm </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1378.14" data-time-end="1380.045"><span>going to put this underneath there. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1380.045" data-time-end="1383.66"><span>And then we're going to come over here </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1383.66" data-time-end="1385.55"><span>and I'm going to go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1385.55" data-time-end="1388.085"><span>here, let see, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1388.085" data-time-end="1391.01"><span>find song, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1391.01" data-time-end="1393.23"><span>so that's going to be the text and I'm going </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1393.23" data-time-end="1395.12"><span>to come up here to the top </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1395.12" data-time-end="1398.94"><span>and then this is going to be Find a button. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1402.73" data-time-end="1405.77"><span>And then let's see, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1405.77" data-time-end="1407.255"><span>when you click it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1407.255" data-time-end="1409.745"><span>we're going to use the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1409.745" data-time-end="1411.649"><span>SongInLlist function to determine </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1411.649" data-time-end="1413.555"><span>if the song in </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1413.555" data-time-end="1416.075"><span>the title text is the song list, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1416.075" data-time-end="1418.31"><span>if the song is in the list, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1418.31" data-time-end="1423.21"><span>then we can continue from there. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1424.24" data-time-end="1427.71"><span>So I'm going to double-click on this </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1428.08" data-time-end="1431.015"><span>and then we're going to say, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1431.015" data-time-end="1435.11"><span>if we want to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1435.11" data-time-end="1437.15"><span>use the method that we just created, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1437.15" data-time-end="1439.655"><span>which is song enlist, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1439.655" data-time-end="1441.89"><span>now, what's a string </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1441.89" data-time-end="1443.285"><span>that we need to give it? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1443.285" data-time-end="1444.62"><span>And the string that we need </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1444.62" data-time-end="1445.7"><span>to give it is going to be </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1445.7" data-time-end="1448.865"><span>whatever is in the title tech box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1448.865" data-time-end="1451.01"><span>So our title text </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1451.01" data-time-end="1452.96"><span>box and then we have to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1452.96" data-time-end="1455.855"><span>remember to use the text property. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1455.855" data-time-end="1459.89"><span>So whatever they type </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1459.89" data-time-end="1462.095"><span>into the title text box, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1462.095" data-time-end="1464.63"><span>we're going to say, are you in the list? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1464.63" data-time-end="1468.35"><span>And then curly brace Enter </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1468.35" data-time-end="1473.27"><span>key and if it is in the list, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1473.27" data-time-end="1475.34"><span>then we need to create </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1475.34" data-time-end="1476.51"><span>a StringBuilder because we </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1476.51" data-time-end="1477.965"><span>want to show the details. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1477.965" data-time-end="1480.41"><span>So declare a StringBuilder </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1480.41" data-time-end="1481.805"><span>if it is in the list, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1481.805" data-time-end="1484.43"><span>so it means it is true. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1484.43" data-time-end="1487.1"><span>So to do the StringBuilder, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1487.1" data-time-end="1488.27"><span>this is come up here and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1488.27" data-time-end="1490.07"><span>grab this right here, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1490.07" data-time-end="1492.575"><span>so now I'm going to do a Control C, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1492.575" data-time-end="1493.37"><span>and I'm going to come down </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1493.37" data-time-end="1494.24"><span>here and do a Control </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1494.24" data-time-end="1496.07"><span>V. And then for this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1496.07" data-time-end="1498.29"><span>I want to make sure that I start empty, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1498.29" data-time-end="1499.865"><span>so it is empty, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1499.865" data-time-end="1502.28"><span>so that's going to create our StringBuilder. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1502.28" data-time-end="1507.74"><span>Then we want to get the index of the song. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1507.74" data-time-end="1510.23"><span>So we're going to go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1510.23" data-time-end="1514.37"><span>songIndex is going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1514.37" data-time-end="1516.245"><span>be and there were to use our other method, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1516.245" data-time-end="1517.94"><span>you can see why we do methods. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1517.94" data-time-end="1521.75"><span>So we're going to say get songIndex </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1521.75" data-time-end="1524.12"><span>and you can see that it's already </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1524.12" data-time-end="1526.25"><span>trying to give me the correct code, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1526.25" data-time-end="1527.36"><span>so you can see Visual Studio's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1527.36" data-time-end="1528.725"><span>trying to write the code for me, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1528.725" data-time-end="1530.15"><span>and it's actually correct, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1530.15" data-time-end="1532.4"><span>so I'm going to hit my Tab key. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1532.4" data-time-end="1537.74"><span>So we're going to use the text that's </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1537.74" data-time-end="1540.305"><span>inside of the text field </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1540.305" data-time-end="1541.88"><span>and we're going to call the second </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1541.88" data-time-end="1543.155"><span>method that we created. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1543.155" data-time-end="1544.925"><span>So we can see why we're doing this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1544.925" data-time-end="1548.195"><span>because it makes our life a lot easier. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1548.195" data-time-end="1550.46"><span>Then if it's true, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1550.46" data-time-end="1557.34"><span>then we want to build the output texts, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1557.41" data-time-end="1560.36"><span>so we're going to say StringBuilder, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1560.36" data-time-end="1562.22"><span>I want to append, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1562.22" data-time-end="1564.335"><span>there weren't used our arrays, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1564.335" data-time-end="1565.55"><span>so we're going to go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1565.55" data-time-end="1566.9"><span>that title array </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1566.9" data-time-end="1572.27"><span>, at what position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1572.27" data-time-end="1576.24"><span>At position song index. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1579.07" data-time-end="1582.64"><span>So we are going to take that array and we're </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1582.64" data-time-end="1585.385"><span>going to pull the information at songIndex. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1585.385" data-time-end="1587.425"><span>Why songIndex? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1587.425" data-time-end="1589.345"><span>Because that's where we found out </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1589.345" data-time-end="1591.615"><span>that our song is located. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1591.615" data-time-end="1593.66"><span>So we said, where's that song </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1593.66" data-time-end="1595.85"><span>located with the index of </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1595.85" data-time-end="1597.11"><span>our song that </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1597.11" data-time-end="1598.55"><span>the person wants to have the details </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1598.55" data-time-end="1601.76"><span>about and then we get the song index, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1601.76" data-time-end="1604.16"><span>so that's the index that we want to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1604.16" data-time-end="1607.37"><span>pull the details from. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1607.37" data-time-end="1609.62"><span>So now what we do want it to be separated, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1609.62" data-time-end="1611.69"><span>wanted to drop down to the next line, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1611.69" data-time-end="1613.52"><span>so we're going to go ahead and do that and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1613.52" data-time-end="1615.29"><span>then we want the artist's name, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1615.29" data-time-end="1622.04"><span>so sb.Append and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1622.04" data-time-end="1625.43"><span>we want to have the artist array </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1625.43" data-time-end="1627.41"><span>, at what position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1627.41" data-time-end="1632.22"><span>We want it to be at songIndex position. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1638.39" data-time-end="1640.95"><span>&gt;&gt; There we go and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1640.95" data-time-end="1643.69"><span>then we want to drop down to the next line, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1645.2" data-time-end="1648.24"><span>so nl, new line </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1648.24" data-time-end="1650.16"><span>because that's the variable </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1650.16" data-time-end="1651.69"><span>that we created up here. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1651.69" data-time-end="1654.615"><span>And then we want to do the same thing. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1654.615" data-time-end="1659.13"><span>So StringBuilder append and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1659.13" data-time-end="1660.57"><span>then we want to append, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1660.57" data-time-end="1664.66"><span>let's see what is next the genre, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1664.79" data-time-end="1669.435"><span>so genre array, at what position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1669.435" data-time-end="1672.55"><span>At song index. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1678.05" data-time-end="1680.4"><span>And then we're going to drop down to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1680.4" data-time-end="1685.26"><span>the next line and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1685.26" data-time-end="1688.35"><span>then we want to pull the year, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1688.35" data-time-end="1690.225"><span>so we're going to go ahead and say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1690.225" data-time-end="1694.92"><span>a StringBuilder append a </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1694.92" data-time-end="1699.465"><span>year array, at what position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1699.465" data-time-end="1702.22"><span>Song index. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1702.56" data-time-end="1704.61"><span>And then we want a dropped down to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1704.61" data-time-end="1710.91"><span>the next line and then we want </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1710.91" data-time-end="1718.805"><span>to do the URL array, at what position? </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1718.805" data-time-end="1721.835"><span>At the same position, song index. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1721.835" data-time-end="1723.29"><span>And then we want to drop </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1723.29" data-time-end="1725.37"><span>down to the next line. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1727.64" data-time-end="1730.455"><span>And then once we have it built like this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1730.455" data-time-end="1731.745"><span>we then want to show it, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1731.745" data-time-end="1732.855"><span>so we're going to go ahead and

class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1744.765" data-time-end="1749.97"><span>So now we want to add a clear song button, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1749.97" data-time-end="1751.08"><span>so I'm going to flip over here to the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1751.08" data-time-end="1752.91"><span>main, I'm going to grab this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1752.91" data-time-end="1757.24"><span>I'm going to cop and then I'm going to paste, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1757.31" data-time-end="1761.985"><span>I'm going to drop it here and clear button, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1761.985" data-time-end="1763.605"><span>so this is selected, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1763.605" data-time-end="1766.32"><span>I'm going to come over here to this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1766.32" data-time-end="1769.02"><span>I'm going to say clear. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1769.02" data-time-end="1773.1"><span>Then I'm going to come up here to top, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1773.68" data-time-end="1776.165"><span>that would have changed this to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1776.165" data-time-end="1778.79"><span>clear button is </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1778.79" data-time-end="1782.4"><span>the object name and </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1782.4" data-time-end="1784.32"><span>then we just want to clear everything, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1784.32" data-time-end="1786.015"><span>so that's going to be very easy. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1786.015" data-time-end="1789.75"><span>So here I double-clicked </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1789.75" data-time-end="1791.43"><span>on the button and then our </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1791.43" data-time-end="1793.99"><span>titleText.Text </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1795.14" data-time-end="1798.24"><span>is a property and we're going to set </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1798.24" data-time-end="1801.66"><span>it to blank just like that and this is </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1801.66" data-time-end="1805.545"><span>one way to clear text, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1805.545" data-time-end="1808.635"><span>text field, text box. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1808.635" data-time-end="1811.54"><span>Then I can say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1812.6" data-time-end="1816.555"><span>artistText.Text is assigned quote, quote, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1816.555" data-time-end="1818.91"><span>that's another or I could </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1818.91" data-time-end="1821.58"><span>have also said string.Empty, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1821.58" data-time-end="1823.725"><span>that's another way to clear it </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1823.725" data-time-end="1826.5"><span>and another way to clear </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1826.5" data-time-end="1828.24"><span>it is to say </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1828.24" data-time-end="1831.42"><span>genre and then instead of saying all this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1831.42" data-time-end="1834.96"><span>I can say dot clear, like that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1834.96" data-time-end="1837.78"><span>So that's a third way, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1837.78" data-time-end="1842.82"><span>so third way to clear and this </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1842.82" data-time-end="1848.44"><span>right here is second way to clear, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1848.51" data-time-end="1851.82"><span>then the year text, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1851.82" data-time-end="1855.81"><span>I'm going to say dot clear and then the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1855.81" data-time-end="1859.575"><span>URL text dot clear, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1859.575" data-time-end="1861.91"><span>so that's going to clear them all out. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1862.01" data-time-end="1865.29"><span>Now want to add a WebView control </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1865.29" data-time-end="1866.52"><span>, this is awesome, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1866.52" data-time-end="1869.55"><span>so we can actually play videos based on </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1869.55" data-time-end="1871.785"><span>that song and then </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1871.785" data-time-end="1873.36"><span>you may have to drag the song, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1873.36" data-time-end="1875.474"><span>listen details boxes smaller. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1875.474" data-time-end="1877.38"><span>So let's go ahead and hit </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1877.38" data-time-end="1881.895"><span>"Designer," then we want to add the control, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1881.895" data-time-end="1885.03"><span>so I'm going to grab this omegas smaller like </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1885.03" data-time-end="1887.61"><span>this and I'm going to click up </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1887.61" data-time-end="1888.63"><span>here and I'm going to make this </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1888.63" data-time-end="1890.775"><span>smaller as well, there we go. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1890.775" data-time-end="1893.865"><span>Then I'll make my form bigger, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1893.865" data-time-end="1894.81"><span>so I'm going to grab this, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1894.81" data-time-end="1896.67"><span>I'm going to pull it to the right, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1896.67" data-time-end="1899.535"><span>so you can see I pulled it past the end, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1899.535" data-time-end="1901.32"><span>so I can have some room, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1901.32" data-time-end="1903.42"><span>so you can see I can pull it passed, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1903.42" data-time-end="1906.6"><span>you see that, so now I can have some room. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1906.6" data-time-end="1909.945"><span>Then the WebView control </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1909.945" data-time-end="1912.57"><span>and in order to add the control, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1912.57" data-time-end="1914.235"><span>you'll need to add a package. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1914.235" data-time-end="1916.215"><span>Right-click on your project

data-time-start="1917.76" data-time-end="1920.43"><span>So this is a solution name right there, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1920.43" data-time-end="1923.67"><span>this is the project name right there. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1923.67" data-time-end="1927.99"><span>Said right-click on

click on that. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="1941.82" data-time-end="1945.69"><span>Then right-click on that, and then it says, </span></span><span

</span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2039.755" data-time-end="2042.799"><span>So you grab the WebView2 control </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part"

WebView selected, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2065.75" data-time-end="2067.04"><span>so the name I'm going to </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2067.04" data-time-end="2073.19"><span>call it WebViewDisplay, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2073.19"

there we go. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2178.835" data-time-end="2182.42"><span>Then I'm going to go over to the right, the name, </span></span><span

</span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2209.62" data-time-end="2212.21"><span>&gt;&gt; So it sets up the event handler, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2212.21" data-time-end="2213.71"><span>and then this is the method </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2213.71"

selected items. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2234.71" data-time-end="2239.675"><span>So songIndex is the list box, </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2239.675" data-time-end="2242.58"><span>and then we can get the </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2250.9"

class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2272.945" data-time-end="2275.93"><span>So now that we </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2275.93"

URL is by using </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2281.39" data-time-end="2285.23"><span>our component and then by </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part" data-time-start="2285.23" data-time-end="2294.725"><span>saying CoreWebView2.Navigate to that URL. </span></span><span class="transcription-time-part"
